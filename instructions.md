# 🌭 How to Play Sausage Slapper 🌭

## Welcome, Sausage Guardian! 👋

Your mission: Keep the sausage alive by slapping it to help it grow, while protecting it from hungry mouths!

## 🎮 Controls
- **Move your mouse** - Control the hand cursor
- **Click** - Slap anything within reach!

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Keep the sausage on screen** - It shrinks when it escapes!
2. **Make it grow** - Slap the sausage to increase its size
3. **Defend from mouths** - Slap away the hungry chompers
4. **Survive as long as possible** - How big can you grow?

## 🎪 How It Works
- **Slap the Sausage** 👋🌭
  - Makes it grow bigger (+5% size)
  - Adds new segments
  - Launches it away from danger
  
- **Slap the Mouths** 👋😬
  - Pushes them away
  - But spawns a new mouth! (careful!)
  
- **Watch the Edges** 🚫
  - Sausage shrinks when it goes off-screen
  - Too small = Game Over!

## 💡 Pro Tips
- Keep the sausage centered - easier to defend!
- Slap mouths strategically - more mouths = harder game
- Time your slaps - wait for the perfect moment
- Watch your sausage size counter - don't let it get below 20!

## 🏁 Game Over
The game ends when:
- **"SAUSAGE ESCAPED!"** - It got too small (size < 20)
- **"SAUSAGE EATEN!"** - A mouth caught it

## 🌟 Challenge Yourself
Can you grow the sausage to size 100? 200? The sky's the limit!

Good luck, and happy slapping! 🎉
